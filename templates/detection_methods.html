        <h1>Rule-Based SMS Phishing Detection</h1>

        <h2>Detection Rules</h2>
        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Suspicious Links</h3>
            <p>The system checks for URLs that could lead to phishing sites.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Click here to win a prize!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Suspicious Keywords</h3>
            <p>Certain words or phrases often used in phishing messages trigger a warning.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Congratulations! You've won a prize!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Time Pressure</h3>
            <p>Messages creating urgency (e.g., "Last chance!" or "Your account will be closed soon") are flagged.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "You must act now!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Fake Authority Claims</h3>
            <p>If the message pretends to be from a trusted authority (e.g., tax office or police), it's considered phishing.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Your account has been suspended due to an unpaid tax."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Unusual Formatting</h3>
            <p>Excessive capitalization, multiple exclamation marks, or ellipses are signs of phishing attempts.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "URGENT!!! YOUR ACCOUNT IS BLOCKED!!!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Foreign Numbers</h3>
            <p>SMS messages originating from foreign numbers (not from a local phone number) are flagged as suspicious.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "+44 20 7946 0958"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Fake Login Links</h3>
            <p>The system checks for links resembling login pages but leading to fake websites.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "log-in to your bank account at www.ziraaatbank.com."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Generic Greetings</h3>
            <p>Phishing messages often use vague greetings like "Dear customer" or "Valued user."</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Dear customer, your account has been compromised."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Each incoming SMS is processed by the <code>is_phishing_sms</code> function.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The message is checked against the predefined rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> If any rule is violated, the message is flagged as phishing.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> The system also provides the specific rule violated for transparency.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
